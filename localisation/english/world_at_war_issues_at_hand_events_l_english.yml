 issues_at_hand_event.1.t:0 "Employment Negotiations In Lockdown"
 issues_at_hand_event.1.desc:0 "Following a failed employment negotiation meeting between the WULT and the EMG, tensions between them have reached a boiling point, threatening to disrupt the delicate balance of production and stability. The dispute revolves around demands for improved working conditions, fair wages, and the right to organize.\n\nThe WULT insists that fair treatment and improved conditions are essential for a healthy, motivated workforce and that neglecting the needs of the labor force will lead to widespread discontent, potential strikes, and a decline in overall productivity. On the other hand, the EMG argues that excessive demands from the WULT will cripple the nation's economy and stifle growth. They emphasize the need for flexibility in labor policies to maintain competitiveness on the global stage. With no progress in sight to solve the issue, both sides have asked for government mediation."
 issues_at_hand_event.1.a:0 "Ignore this issue."
 issues_at_hand_event.1.b:0 "Mediate in favor of the WULT."
 issues_at_hand_event.1.c:0 "Mediate in favor of the EMG."

 issues_at_hand_event.2.t:0 "Exodus of Army Dissidents"
 issues_at_hand_event.2.desc:0 "Amidst the ongoing military reorganization in [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyNameDef], the enforcement of stricter guidelines and practices has unintentionally given rise to a recruitment surge for the IV. Comprised largely of individuals deemed undesirable by the new military standards, the IV is swelling in size and influence by the day, prompting concerns from the AMO. They urgently advocate for the government to take legal action, proposing the implementation of harsher laws to address the growing threat posed by the IV."
 issues_at_hand_event.2.a:0 "Ignore this issue."
 issues_at_hand_event.2.b:0 "We must listen to the AMO."
 issues_at_hand_event.2.c:0 "The IV is tolerable, maybe even beneficial?"
 
 
 issues_at_hand_event.3.t:0 "A Meeting With The Don"
 issues_at_hand_event.3.desc:0 "Ahh, [ROOT.GetLeader], my favorite politician! It's a pleasure as always doing business with you. We've gotten far in our unconventional partnership and advanced it to a whole new level, and I salute you for it. Now, with new heights come new opportunities, right? Well, I have an offer you simply can't refuse...\n\nThe thing is, our golden rule is to never go against family, and you're now one step away from truly becoming part of it. There's only one little issue - I worry for your health. Being the leader of the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] and the whole country must be such an arduous task. You wouldn't mind if I shouldered some of that weight myself, capisce?"

 issues_at_hand_event.3.a:0 "I refuse!.. Hey wait, where are you taking me?!"
 issues_at_hand_event.3.b:0 "Please spare my life, I'll do anything you ask!"

 issues_at_hand_event.4.t:0 "A Tale of Two Uneasy Alliances"
 issues_at_hand_event.4.desc:0 "As [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] faces the challenges of war and resource scarcity, the government has been compelled to introduce rationing measures to ensure fair distribution of essential and precious goods, alcohol included. This in turn has given rise to a contentious debate over the outright prohibition of alcohol, revealing unexpected alliances and divisions within society. The SRS argues that such a measure will preserve moral integrity and maintain social order, and that it's perfect timing to implement it alongside the rationing now that alcohol already is a scarcity. Much to everyone's surprise, they've also gained full support from the BS, whose motivations remain unclear.\n\nMeanwhile, another unlikely coalition has formed, opposing the alcohol ban. Both the WULT and the AL argue that individual freedoms and the social fabric should not be sacrificed, even in times of war. Besides, what's a good Friday night without a beer, and what's a fancy display cabinet without an expensive bottle of whisky?"
 issues_at_hand_event.4.a:0 "Ignore this issue."
 issues_at_hand_event.4.b:0 "The scourge of alcohol has destroyed too many families already."
 issues_at_hand_event.4.c:0 "A toast for alcoholism!"
 
 issues_at_hand_event.5.t:0 "Mobilization of Factory Workers"
 issues_at_hand_event.5.desc:0 "As the fires of war rage on, a critical decision looms on the home front. The AMO fervently demands a surge of soldiers to the front lines, urging for an increase in factory worker mobilization and longer working hours to meet the escalating demands of the war effort. However, the WULT stands firm, asserting the need to keep laborers in the factories to maintain essential production for the war."

 issues_at_hand_event.5.b:0 "More meat for the meatgrinder!"
 issues_at_hand_event.5.c:0 "The workers are needed at the home front."
 
 issues_at_hand_event.6.t:0 "The Missing Link"
 issues_at_hand_event.6.desc:0 "Following the completion of the national railway expansion project, a cargo train loaded with armaments earmarked for the military has mysteriously disappeared from a railway depot. Intelligence reports strongly point towards the notorious BS as the chief suspect. Question remains whether to conduct an investigation, or to cover-up the embarrassing incident altogether and save face."

 issues_at_hand_event.6.b:0 "Conduct a major cordon and search operation."
 issues_at_hand_event.6.c:0 "A minor investigation should be enough."

 issues_at_hand_event.7.t:0 "Drive For Dominance"
 issues_at_hand_event.7.desc:0 "In the wake of our relentless pursuit of modernization, the motorization of the armed forces stands as a testament to progress. However, as the wheels of innovation turn, a minor yet consequential dispute has emerged between a distinguished scientist from the ACS and an astute factory owner from the EMG. This disagreement centers around the patent rights for crucial components integral to an armored car prototype.\n\nThe ACS asserts that the success of the armored car design is rooted in their pioneering scientific research. Conversely, EMG contends that their substantial financial backing and streamlined manufacturing processes played an integral role in transforming these theoretical concepts into tangible protoypes in the test facilities. Both the ACS and the EMG appeal for the government to arbitrate and determine the rightful owner of the patent for these essential armored car components."

 issues_at_hand_event.8.t:0 "Underworld Vigilance"
 issues_at_hand_event.8.desc:0 "Following the government's effort in fortifying the urban areas, a new chapter unfolds on the streets of the cities. Believing they act in accordance with the government's agenda, the IV has taken the initiative to start patrolling the cities at night. Although perhaps well-intentioned, this bold move has not been sanctioned by the government. Most importantly, this has also started to disrupt the longstanding order of the underworld maintained by the BS in the shadows. Violent clashes and street fights have sparked between the IV and the BS, leading to escalating tensions and increased public anxiety."

 issues_at_hand_event.9.t:0 "Explosive Accusations"
 issues_at_hand_event.9.desc:0 "A devastating explosion has torn through one of our armaments factories, resulting in the tragic loss of life among the dedicated workers. In the aftermath, chaos ensues as blame is cast in every direction, with the WULT, the EMG, and the ACS each pointing fingers at the other, refusing to shoulder responsibility. The lack of concrete evidence regarding the cause of the explosion has only intensified the blame game. The WULT insists on inadequate safety measures and worker negligence, the EMG claims substandard materials and faulty equipment, while the ACS argues that experimental research and innovations were sabotaged by external forces."

 issues_at_hand_event.10.t:0 "Iron Inheritance"
 issues_at_hand_event.10.desc:0 "In the midst of our nation's strategic resource prospecting, a noteworthy discovery has emerged - an untapped reservoir of iron nestled in the countryside! However, the path to harnessing this strategic asset is obstructed by unfortunate circumstances.\n\nThe identified land belongs to a distinguished nobleman deeply rooted in the AL, with the property carrying generations of historical significance. The nobleman, committed to preserving familial traditions, vehemently opposes any attempts to exploit the land's resources. The iron reserve holds promise for our wartime endeavors, yet the intersection of historical ties and national interest adds layers of complexity to the decision-making process."

 issues_at_hand_event.10.b:0 "We must respect the historical claim."
