 # Sam Hyde's 'Hitler's Top Guy' comedy sketch transcript (modified)
 XYZ_professional_agitator_XYZ_professional_agitator_desc:0 "I really don't like a certain powerful dictator and I disapprove of what he did... But I would still love to be in his enemy's occupied capital. Again, hear me out on this one, because I think I would have made a very good soldier, probably, I would imagine. I did good in highschool sports, I think I would've been the dictator's top soldier. My point is that I would've been some sort of elite shock troop, you know, probably some sort of special forces - the dicator's special forces, right? Like, okay, here's the thing: No matter how much you disapprove of the guy, no matter how much you dislike him, which I DO... Uhh...\n\nLook, notorious figures throughout history. You got all the bad guys in history, you got the whole lineup. What if one of them was looking at YOU, saying: 'Hey, you're my go-to guy. You're MY guy that I go to when I need a problem solved'? What if this dictator was saying this to YOU? Can you imagine that for a second?! What if he said that you're such a physical beast, dude, you're such a physical, nasty beast that I'm basically gonna make you in charge of a platoon of panzers, okay? You're basically so hunked up and shredded that I have no choice but to make you a legend in the empire...\n\nI would say to myself: Man, this dictator guy is up to no good. I hate this, I can't take anymore of this! I don't know what I'm gonna do... But I'm the dictator's top guy! What am I gonna do?! Our dictator chose me to lead the revolution!\n\nIf Alexander the Great tells you you're his top guy; You're his top guy! - You're now in a position where you have no choice but to go: 'Wow, I'm Alexander the Great's top guy, dude!' or 'Woah! the dictator needs me? Okay, I'll do it. I'm going to bat for you, man! I got your back, dude!'\n\n... Okay? That's my point. And I say that with the MOST respect for any victims of the dictator and the MOST disdain for the dictator and his actions."

 ### SCIENTISTS ###
 
 # 'The Missile Knows Where It Is' Copypasta extended
 XYZ_rocket_scientist_XYZ_rocket_scientist_desc:0 "The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is - whichever is greater - it obtains a difference or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position that it wasn't, it now is.\n\nConsequently, the position where it is is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was is now the position that it isn't. In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation. The variation being the difference between where the missile is and where it wasn't.\n\nIf variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows: Because a variation has modified some of the information that the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it know where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice versa. And by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.\n\nIn this way, it can determine its current position in space and time, its new position, its position in time, its new position in space and time, and so forth. This mathematical process is performed in a number of stages. If the error should exceed some figure of merit, the stage-1 and stage-2 part of the process change according to the figure of merit. A temperature of 4 degrees above zero Celsius is considered to be high. So the stage-1 part of the system now is included in a correction, to obtain a low point in the system and one in the error.\n\nThen when the system reaches a stage-2 part, the stage-1 part is deleted from the corrective stage-2, to obtain a zero error stage. This is where the discrepancy between where the missile is and where it should be can now be compared with its destination, by simply adding the two figures of merit. Correcting error may produce higher speeds and greater accuracy than conventional anti-ballistic missiles."
